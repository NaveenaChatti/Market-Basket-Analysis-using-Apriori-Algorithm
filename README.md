# Market-Basket-Analysis
In this project, you performed a Market Basket Analysis on an online retail dataset. First, you loaded the data, explored its structure, and cleaned it by removing transactions with returns or missing values. You then focused on the first 5,000 unique invoices and transformed the data into a format suitable for the Apriori algorithm.

Using Apriori, you identified frequent itemsets and generated association rules with a minimum confidence threshold. You analyzed these rules to uncover strong relationships between products, like teacups and wicker items. You validated the results using the Chi-Square Test and visualized product associations with heatmaps.

In conclusion, this analysis provided valuable insights into product co-occurrence, helping businesses optimize product placement, promotions, and cross-selling strategies.
